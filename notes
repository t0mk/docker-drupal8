Drupal 8 on Docker, from development to deployment


- There are several nginx approacehs to deploy d8.
- nginx would need at least two processes in the docker container - nginx and php-fpm. php-fpm could be a different image but would have to share a volume with the nginx container which needs to server static files straight up. Apache seems to be most convenient for simple setup - apache with mod_php only needs the drupal code tree for itself.
- db - container, create db and grant user pass
- generic db containers, or remake
- repack for redeployment
- maybe deploy to k8s
